## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - The dataset contains information such as location, number of rooms, size, and other features influencing house prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
   - Encode categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Feature selection and creation of new features based on domain knowledge.

4. **Model Training**
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are used.
   - Cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

6. **Model Serialization**
   - Save the best-performing model for deployment.
